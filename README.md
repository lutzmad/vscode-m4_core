# M4 README

This is the README for the extension "M4 Core".

This is a simple M4 core syntax highlighting extension.

The standard POSIX and the GNU M4 buildin commands should be handled properly, based on the default quotation. By default M4 uses "`" and "'" as quotes.

The quote delimiters can be changed with the builtin "changequote", but this is not taken into account by the extension. In general "changequote" is evil and should not used.

Keep in mind, M4SUGAR, M4SH, AUTOCONF and AUTOTEST have chosen to use "[" and "]" for quotation. The mostly used AUTOCONF macros are not highlighted, therefore.

## Features

The extension does not contain any specific features.

The standard POSIX and the GNU M4 buildin commands should be handled properly, as long as the default M4 quotes "`" and "'" are used.

Keep in mind, in general "changequote" is evil and should not used.
